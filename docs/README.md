## How to use

> There are 6 servers that need to be opened:
  - api-gateway (centralization of all the APIs)
  - account-manager (login and register)
  - party-manager (creating and joining a party)
  - song-manager (manages the Spotify API for meta-data)
  - serverUpload (for uploading a file on local)
  - server (render dynamically all the pages)
 > Start on "https://localhost:8089/register", which will prompt you to register an account. After that:
  - either if you create or want to join a party, the first thing should be uploading a .mp3 file 
  - add a name for a party (for creating) or add a party code (for joining)
  - add your favourite artist, genre and song, which should be used for automatisation
  - you will be redirected to a party page where the Gyroscope API will measure your movements and determine the next songs based on those movements
